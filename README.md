## 🐯 Introduction

* Java backend: JDK 8 + Spring Boot 2.7
* The backend uses Spring Boot multi-module architecture, MySQL + MyBatis Plus, Redis + Redisson
* The database can use MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MariaDB, domestic DM, TiDB, etc.
* Message queues can use Event, Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka, RocketMQ, etc.
* Permission authentication uses Spring Security & Token & Redis, supports multi-terminal, multi-user authentication system, and supports SSO single sign-on.
* Support loading dynamic permission menu, button-level permission control, and Redis cache to improve performance.
* Supports SaaS multi-tenancy, can customize the permissions of each tenant, and provide transparent multi-tenant underlying encapsulation.
* Highly efficient development, using the code generator to generate Java, Vue front-end and back-end code, SQL scripts, interface documents in one click, supporting single table, tree table, master-subtable.
* Real-time communication, implemented using Spring WebSocket, built-in Token identity verification, and support for WebSocket clusters.
* Integrate SMS channels such as Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud, and cloud storage services such as MinIO, Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, and Qiniu Cloud.
